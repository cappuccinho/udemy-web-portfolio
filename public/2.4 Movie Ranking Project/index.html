        <p>Dear Marquis, I hope this letter finds you in good health and state. I'm doing fine, although I wish there were more hours in the day. It's just so much to do. Time is changing slowly but surely and it's men like you will make a difference. Your military success is a credit,not only to you but your race as well. I'm very proud every time I heard news of you. We still have a long way to go, but hand in hand. I know we'll get there. I just want to let you know you're in my thoughts. Hopefully our paths will cross in the future. Until then I remain you friend. Ole Mary Todd is calling, so I guess it must be time for bed. Respectfully, Abraham Lincoln</p>
